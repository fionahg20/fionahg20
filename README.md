# fionahg20 - 'Nerd in-training'
 
Hi, thanks for visiting! :)

I studied part-time for six years with The Open University to graduate, with BSc Hons degree in Computing & IT, at the end of 2019.

I'm on Day 8 of a #100DaysOfCode challenge to help refresh my practical coding skills ready for a first development role.

With plenty of life and work experience (I am a mature student!) I will bring enthusiasm, adaptability and a fresh approach to your team, along with a barrage of useful 'soft' skills.
